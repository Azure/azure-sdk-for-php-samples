PRE-REQUISITES BEFORE USING THIS SAMPLE

*************************************************

Step 1: Create the Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS.dll 

*************************************************

In order to use the PowerShell cmdlets provided under the %ROOT%/php/scripts/ directory, you will need to build the DLL that provides the WAAD functionality. 

We have included the source for building this DLL in this code for your convenience. It is located at:

%ROOT%/csharp/code/libraries/powershell/Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS/

You have two options to build this DLL:

1. Build using VS 2010 Tools Command Line and included batch file

You can build this DLL easily by running:

 %ROOT%/csharp/code/libraries/powershell/Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS/buildWaadPS.bat

This will build the DLL and copy the DLL to the correct location under %ROOT%/php/scripts/

2. Load the .csproj file and build under Visual Studio 2010 or higher

This is located under %ROOT%/csharp/code/libraries/powershell/Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS. You will need to ensure that the Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS.dll file is moved to the correct location under %ROOT%/csharp/scripts/
